# Supports of submonoids

Let `G` be an (additive) group, and let `M` be a submonoid of `G`.
The *support* of `M` is `M ∩ -M`, the largest subgroup of `G` contained in `M`.
A submonoid `C` is *pointed*, or a *positive cone*, if it has zero support.
A submonoid `C` is *spanning* if the subgroup it generates is `G` itself.

The names for these concepts are taken from the theory of convex cones.

## Main definitions

* `AddSubmonoid.support`: the support of a submonoid.
* `AddSubmonoid.IsPointed`: typeclass for submonoids with zero support.
* `AddSubmonoid.IsSpanning`: typeclass for submonoids generating the whole group.
